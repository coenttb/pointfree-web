# swift-web: A Modular Web Foundation in Swift

Welcome to **swift-web** - an updated fork of PointFree's [swift-web](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-web). It is a collection of focused modules designed to simplify and streamline web development in Swift. This repository provides reusable building blocks that can be integrated into any Swift-based server or web project.

Each module is crafted for a specific responsibility, ensuring clean architecture and maintainable code. If you're building with Vapor, SwiftNIO, or other Swift server-side frameworks, **swift-web** can help you handle common tasks elegantly.
